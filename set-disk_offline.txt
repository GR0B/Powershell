# I have an old loud mechanical drive I use for backups, but was finding it was randomly spinning up when system was idle
# So to address this I added the powershell below to shortcuts and then offline the disk when not needed
# as this effectivly unmounts the disk from Windows I no longer have an issue of it spinning up or being accesses randomly in the 
# background by services/applications when I do not need to access the disk. 

# This was seen as a software alternative to wiring up a power switch to the drives

# switch a drive to offline (unmount from Windows)
set-disk (get-partition -DriveLetter F | get-disk | select number -ExpandProperty number) -isOffline $true


# set all offline disks back to online (remount)
Get-Disk | Where-Object IsOffline -Eq $True | Set-Disk -IsOffline $False
